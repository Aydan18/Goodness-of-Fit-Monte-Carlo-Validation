        "Next, we multiply out the brackets inside the integral, which results in three distinct terms. We simplify terms involving sums over $j$ and $k$ where indices are independent, utilizing the property that $\\sum_{j=1}^n a_j + \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k = 2 \\sum_{j=1}^n a_j$. Terms that are independent of the summation index are treated as constants and converted into a product of the term with $n$ (or $n^2$ for double sums).\n",
        "\n",
        "Subsequently, we can swap the integral with the finite series (summation) due to the linearity of integration and the finite nature of the series, allowing us to apply the Lebesgue integration. Finally, we multiply the leading $\\frac{1}{n}$ factor with all three resulting terms to obtain the simplified expression.\n",
